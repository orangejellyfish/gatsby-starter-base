# gatsby-starter-base

A basic starter kit for [Gatsby][gatsby] following [orangejellyfish][oj]
JavaScript best practices. This kit is intended for the development of simple
static sites. If you have more complex requirements one of our alternative kits
might better suit your needs:

## Features

- React 16 support via [gatsby-plugin-react-next][gprn]
- Bootstrap 4 support via [reactstrap][rs]
- Unit testing with [Jest][jest] and [Enzyme][enz]
- Global styling with [Sass][sass]
- orangejellyfish ESLint configuration

If you have more complex requirements one of our alternative kits, built upon
this base, might better suit your needs:

- [gatsby-starter-netlify-cms][gsnc] adds in support for editing site content
  in Netlify CMS.

- [gatsby-starter-blog][gsb] builds upon the Netlify CMS starter to include a
  blogging framework.

## Usage

The kit requires Node (version 8 or above recommended) and npm (version 5.2 or
above recommended). If those are available on your system you can use [npx][npx]
to quickly scaffold a new site from the kit:

```sh
npx -p gatsby-cli gatsby new $DIR_NAME https://github.com/orangejellyfish/gatsby-starter-base
cd $DIR_NAME
npm start
```

## Conventions

Gatsby is a very flexible tool. In order to reduce some of the configuration
overhead associated with such flexibility we favour the following conventions:

- A "layout" is viewed as a common parent to multiple pages. It is represented
  as a React component exported from a file in the `src/layouts` directory.

- A "page" is viewed as an individual web page. A page is represented as a
  React component exported from a file in the `src/pages` directory.

- Simple components (those that are not pages or layouts and generally receive
  data as props from ancestor components that pull in data from GraphQL) are
  placed in the `src/components` directory.
